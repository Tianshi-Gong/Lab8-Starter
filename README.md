Graceful degradation is a design process where an application is built to be functional when disabling a large part of the system. Service workers play a important role in graceful degradation by enabling offline capabilities, caching, and background synchronization for web applications. This relationship allows developers to enhance the application for modern browsers while maintaining core functionality across all browsers, thereby gracefully degrading the experience without completely breaking it.
