Graceful degradation is a design process where an application is built to be functional when disabling a large part of the system. Service workers play a important role in graceful degradation by enabling offline capabilities, caching, and background synchronization for web applications. This relationship enables developers to improve the application for browsers while preserving essential functionality on all browsers, thus ensuring the experience degrades gracefully without causing complete failure.
